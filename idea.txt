We've built a basic Django application / API and now need to integrate the HTML/CSS templates.

We have already created the API and the HTML/CSS templates (HTML preview is available here: https://rebrand.ly/904c7), your task is to integrate the HTML/CSS with the API.

A summary of the tasks:
- Load and display list of Entities using GET /v1/entities/ endpoint
- Enable search of Entities using GET /v1/entities/ endpoint
- Implement form workflow, with final review + submission to POST /v1/notifications/
- Implement Google Places API search
- Add JS tracking tags (using Segment.io tracking code)

We would also like to integrate Firebase Auth at the final stage of the user journey.

This is quite an urgent task, so I appreciate if you can provide information on time estimate.

Thanks
